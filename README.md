**Project 1**

**Description:** This project (`Project-1`) was focused on creating a scene containing different objects composed of primitives created by us (cubes, cones, cylinders, etc). These primitives were created using the WebCGF library created by the professors, which gave a level of abstraction over WebGL.

We had to compose a scene using these objects and the concepts of shading, ligthing, etc..

**Technologies:** Javascript, C++/GLSL Shaders

**Skills/Concepts:** 3D modelling, computer graphics basic concepts, shading, scene lighting, creativity, textures

**Grade:** 19.1/20

**Project 2**

**Description:** For this project (`Project-2`)  we used once again the primitives created in the previous project (and additionally a sphere created by us) to create another scene, this time using additional concepts and technologies such as GLSL shaders, heigh-maps, L-Systems for randomly generating tree branches. This project also included a more game-like aspect were we had to create an interface with the user to control an animated bird built by us.

**Technologies:** Javascript, C++/GLSL Shaders

**Skills/Concepts:** 3D modelling, computer graphics basic concepts, animation, L-systems, game I/Om, height maps, shading, scene lighting, creativity, textures

**Grade:** 19.5/20
